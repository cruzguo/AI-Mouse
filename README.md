ðŸ‘‹ Hello! This time, I have created an AI Mouse Software in Python that allows users to control various functions on their computer through intuitive mouse gestures.
Such functions my software provides are left clicks, right clicks, cursor movement, etc. all through the movement of your index finger and thumb. 
To run the software, you need a camera (the default camera in your laptop works just fine) and a programming software compatitble with Python 3.8 and the packages, openc-python, mediapipe, and PyAutoGui 3.20. 
Once you have everything downloaded and installed, simply press the run button on your programming software!
